# 🗂️ Searching Techniques

This folder contains implementations of searching algorithms, essential for locating specific data within structures efficiently.

## 📜 Files and Descriptions

- **`Binary Search.c`**  
  Implements binary search, an efficient method for finding an element in a sorted array with O(log n) complexity.

- **`Binary search (1).c`**  
  Recursive implementation of binary search with similar logic.

- **`Linear search.c`**  
  Implements linear search, a straightforward method that checks every element until a match is found.

## 💡 Key Takeaways

These searching techniques illustrate:

- How to access **data efficiently**.
- The trade-off between simplicity (linear search) and efficiency (binary search).
