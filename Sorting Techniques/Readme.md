# 🗂️ Sorting Techniques

This folder contains implementations of various sorting algorithms, which are fundamental for arranging data in specific orders. Sorting is a key concept in computer science, widely used in data analysis, searching, and other operations.

## 📜 Files and Descriptions

- **`Bubble sort.c`**  
  Implements the bubble sort algorithm, which repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

- **`Insertion sort.c`**  
  Implements the insertion sort algorithm, which builds the sorted list one element at a time.

- **`Selection sort.c`**  
  Implements the selection sort algorithm, which repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion and places it in the correct position.

## 💡 Key Takeaways

These sorting algorithms demonstrate:

- **Iterative approaches** to organizing data.
- Differences in efficiency, with varying time complexities like O(n²).
